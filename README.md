# dotfiles

My vim, zsh, git and other config files.

## Usage

These dotfiles are written for Ubuntu 17.10 LTS. My terminal of choice is GNOME
terminal. Setting up these dotfiles *should* be easy: clone the repo and run the
setup script. If you want the solarized color scheme to install without issues,
be sure that you have a terminal profile named Default.

## What is installed?

* NPM
* Node
* PostgeSQL
* Ruby
* Solarized (light and dark)
* Vim
* Yarn
* rbenv and the ruby-build plugin
* tmux
* vim-plug
